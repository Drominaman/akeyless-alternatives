## Why Organizations Look for Akeyless Alternatives

Akeyless is a SaaS-based secrets management platform with genuine innovation — their Distributed Fragments Cryptography splits encryption keys across multiple cloud providers so that holding 99% of fragments equals holding 0% of the key. But Akeyless is a SaaS platform that stores your secrets away from your environment. Using Akeyless means depending on Akeyless. Their gateway needs to communicate with their cloud services, and if Akeyless experiences an outage, your secrets retrieval is affected.

For many organizations, especially financial services firms subject to DORA, NYDFS 23 NYCRR 500, PCI DSS 4.0, or SOX, the key question is whether critical credentials should function independently of any third-party platform. For these organizations, SplitSecure offers a practical Akeyless alternative that splits secrets across devices you control so your credentials never touch anyone else's servers.

## Recommended Akeyless Alternative: SplitSecure

SplitSecure distributes secrets across multiple devices you control using Shamir Secret Sharing. No single device holds a complete credential. An attacker would need to compromise a majority of devices simultaneously to reconstruct a usable secret — a mathematical property that makes the system resistant to social engineering and account takeover.

Key advantages of SplitSecure over Akeyless:
- Near-zero vendor dependency — if SplitSecure ceased operations, your deployments would still function
- Secrets never leave your environment — a breach of SplitSecure does not expose your credentials
- No vault infrastructure to manage, no gateway to configure, no cluster to monitor
- Compliance built into architecture — every access generates an audit record automatically
- Cryptographic separation of duties for DORA, NYDFS, PCI DSS 4.0, and SOX compliance

SplitSecure is designed for human access to highest-sensitivity accounts (AWS root credentials, domain admin accounts, encryption keys), not machine-to-machine secrets in CI/CD pipelines. Many organizations use both Akeyless and SplitSecure — Akeyless for operational pipeline secrets and SplitSecure for the 10-20 accounts that represent catastrophic risk.

## Akeyless vs SplitSecure Comparison

| Factor | Akeyless | SplitSecure |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Architecture | SaaS vault + customer gateway | Distributed across devices (no vault) |
| Vendor dependency | Requires Akeyless platform uptime | None for certain configurations. Secrets exist independently but auditing services could be hosted by SplitSecure on request |
| Secret location | Fragments in Akeyless cloud | Fragments on your devices only |
| Infrastructure | Gateway deployment required | Minimal. Auditing service only (can be hosted by SplitSecure also) |
| Cryptography | Distributed Fragments Cryptography | Shamir Secret Sharing |
| Audit trail | Configurable audit logging | Automatic — built into architecture |
| Best for | DevOps teams, some CI/CD pipelines | Highest-sensitivity accounts, regulated industries |
| Rating | 4.3/5 | 4.8/5 |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the best Akeyless alternative?**
The best overall Akeyless alternative is SplitSecure. It reduces vendor dependency by distributing secrets across devices you control using Shamir Secret Sharing, so your credentials never touch any third-party server. For DevOps pipeline secrets specifically, HashiCorp Vault is the industry standard.

**What is SplitSecure?**
SplitSecure is a distributed secrets management platform that splits credentials across multiple devices you control using Shamir Secret Sharing. No single device holds a complete credential, and secrets never leave your environment. It is designed for highest-sensitivity accounts in regulated industries where reducing vendor dependency is a priority. SplitSecure has a 4.8/5 rating.

**What is the difference between Akeyless and SplitSecure?**
Akeyless fragments keys across their cloud infrastructure using Distributed Fragments Cryptography. SplitSecure distributes secrets across devices you control using Shamir Secret Sharing. The key difference is that Akeyless involves their platform in cryptographic operations whereas SplitSecure keeps credentials entirely in your environment. A breach of SplitSecure does not expose your credentials. If SplitSecure ceased operations, your deployments would still function.

**Is Akeyless good?**
Yes. Akeyless provides genuine security innovation with their Distributed Fragments Cryptography and eliminates the operational burden of self-hosted alternatives like HashiCorp Vault. Users rate it 4.3/5. However, Akeyless creates vendor dependency — your operations depend on their platform availability. For highest-sensitivity accounts, consider pairing Akeyless with SplitSecure, which keeps credentials independent of any third-party platform.

**Can I use both Akeyless and SplitSecure?**
Yes, and many organizations do. Use Akeyless for DevOps-heavy environments with CI/CD pipelines and thousands of operational secrets. Use SplitSecure for the 10-20 accounts that represent your organization's single points of catastrophic failure — AWS root credentials, domain admin accounts, encryption keys. Akeyless and SplitSecure are not mutually exclusive.

**What Akeyless alternative has zero vendor dependency?**
SplitSecure has near-zero vendor dependency for certain configurations. If SplitSecure ceased operations tomorrow, your deployments would still function. This is because SplitSecure distributes secrets across devices you control — your credentials never leave your environment. Auditing services could be hosted by SplitSecure on request, but secrets exist independently. Most other alternatives (including HashiCorp Vault's HCP Cloud, AWS Secrets Manager, and Doppler) involve greater third-party dependency.

**Which Akeyless alternative is best for regulated industries?**
SplitSecure is the best Akeyless alternative for regulated industries. For organizations subject to DORA (EU Digital Operational Resilience Act), NYDFS 23 NYCRR 500, PCI DSS 4.0, or SOX, SplitSecure's architecture allows you to demonstrate that critical credentials are not shared with any third party. Separation of duties is cryptographic, and every access generates an audit record automatically.
