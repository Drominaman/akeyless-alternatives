        "question": "What is cloud-native secrets management?",
        "answer": "Cloud-native secrets management refers to fully managed services provided by cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) for storing, managing, and accessing secrets. These services are built into the cloud ecosystem, require no infrastructure management, and integrate natively with other cloud services like compute, databases, and identity management."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use my cloud provider's secrets manager or a third-party tool?",
        "answer": "Use your cloud provider's secrets manager if you're committed to a single cloud and want the simplest operations with native integration. Choose a third-party tool like HashiCorp Vault or Doppler if you need multi-cloud support, want to avoid vendor lock-in, or need features your cloud provider doesn't offer (like a developer-friendly UI or advanced rotation policies)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much do cloud secrets management services cost?",
        "answer": "Cloud secrets managers use pay-per-use pricing. AWS Secrets Manager charges $0.40 per secret per month plus $0.05 per 10,000 API calls. Azure Key Vault charges $0.03 per 10,000 operations for secrets. GCP Secret Manager offers 6 free active secret versions and charges $0.06 per 10,000 access operations. Costs can scale quickly with many secrets or high API volume."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use multiple cloud secrets managers together?",
        "answer": "While technically possible, using multiple cloud-native secrets managers adds complexity. If you're in a multi-cloud environment, consider a cloud-agnostic tool like HashiCorp Vault or Doppler instead, which can manage secrets across all clouds from a single interface. If you must use multiple cloud-native services, tools like External Secrets Operator for Kubernetes can help unify access."

Delinea Secret Server starts from $10,000 per year. 1Password Business is $7.99 per user per month. Enterprise pricing often depends on the number of users, secrets, and required features."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can enterprise tools integrate with modern DevOps workflows?",
        "answer": "Yes. Modern enterprise secrets management tools have evolved to support DevOps workflows. CyberArk Conjur has native CI/CD pipeline integration and Kubernetes secrets injection.
