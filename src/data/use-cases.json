      {
        "question": "Why do DevOps teams need secrets management?",
        "answer": "DevOps teams handle credentials across multiple environments (dev, staging, production), CI/CD pipelines, containers, and cloud services. Without proper secrets management, credentials end up hardcoded in code, stored in plaintext .env files, or embedded in CI/CD variables — creating security risks, making rotation difficult, and lacking audit trails."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between a secrets manager and a .env file?",
        "answer": "A .env file is a local plaintext file that stores credentials for one environment on one machine. A secrets manager provides centralized storage with encryption, access control, audit logging, automatic rotation, environment-based scoping, and the ability to share secrets securely across teams and systems. Secrets managers eliminate the risk of accidentally committing credentials to version control."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which DevOps secrets manager has the best developer experience?",
        "answer": "Doppler and Infisical are widely regarded as having the best developer experience. Doppler's CLI and dashboard make it easy to manage secrets across environments with automatic syncing. Infisical offers a similar experience with the added benefit of open source self-hosting. HashiCorp Vault is more powerful but has a steeper learning curve."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I migrate from .env files to a secrets manager gradually?",
        "answer": "Yes. Most secrets managers support gradual migration. You can start by importing your .env files into the secrets manager, then update one service at a time to pull from the new source. Tools like Doppler and Infisical can generate .env-compatible output, so you can update your workflow without changing application code."

        "question": "Why shouldn't I store secrets in CI/CD platform variables?",

External secrets managers provide centralized management, automatic rotation, detailed audit trails, and the ability to generate short-lived credentials for each build."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are dynamic secrets and why are they important for CI/CD?",
        "answer": "Dynamic secrets are credentials generated on-demand with a limited time-to-live (TTL). In CI/CD, this means each build gets unique database credentials or API tokens that automatically expire when the build completes. This eliminates the risk of credential reuse, limits blast radius if a build is compromised, and removes the need for manual rotation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I prevent secrets from leaking in CI/CD logs?",
        "answer": "Use your secrets manager's CI/CD plugin which automatically masks secrets in logs. Avoid printing environment variables in debug output. Use the secrets manager's CLI to inject secrets at runtime rather than as build arguments. Enable log scrubbing features in your CI/CD platform. Some tools like Doppler automatically detect and redact secrets in output."

        "question": "Which CI/CD platforms are best supported by secrets managers?",
        "answer": "GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins have the broadest support across all major secrets managers. CircleCI, Bitbucket Pipelines, Azure DevOps, and AWS CodePipeline are also well-supported. HashiCorp Vault has the widest CI/CD platform coverage, while Doppler and Infisical offer the simplest integration experience."

        "answer": "One multi-cloud tool is better for: consistent policies, simplified operations, and avoiding vendor lock-in. Multiple cloud-native tools are better for: maximum cloud integration depth, teams organized by cloud, and minimal cross-cloud secret sharing. Most multi-cloud organizations benefit from a central tool with selective sync to cloud-native stores where needed."
